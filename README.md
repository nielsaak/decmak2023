# P-ORL: Primate Gambling Task Modeling

Welcome to the P-ORL project, where we delve into the intricacies of modeling the Primate Gambling Task (PGT), a specialized case derived from the renowned Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). This repository is the code repository for an exam paper on the subject.

## Overview

The P-ORL model is designed to simulate and analyze the cognitive aspects of primates engaging in the Primate Gambling Task. By focusing on this specific variant of the Iowa Gambling Task, we aim to unravel the nuances of decision-making, risk assessment, and reward processing in primate species.
